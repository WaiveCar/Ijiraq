<h1>The quickest way to sell screen time</h1>
<p>
At olvr we focus on volume. Our ad making technology allows both less technically able people to advertise quicker and an engine that produces advertisements which can work on any screen.
</p>
<p>
All you need to do is add a URL to your web-enabled DSP platform.
</p>
<p>
It has code that will automatically track the number of screens it is on and how long our platform is on.
We find out the dimensions of each screen and serve appropriate ads all you need to do is collect your money.
</p>
<p>
Signing up is easy.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Give us your email and we'll email you a unique URL. </li>
  <li>Add it to your platform and we'll email you along the way.</li>
  <li>When you accrue $5 in revenue, we'll email you and you can set up payout options.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it.
