Schedulers
  They suck because most content looks canned and unengaging
  It's a valuable abstraction but not to facilitate repetitive laziness

FB isn't targetted, focused, or streamlined enough for friction-free business interactions.

Social media management produces terrible results

Adaptive layouts for different mediums (resolution, aspect ratio)

Give them an ability to take their content and go elsewhere.
  The tool becomes a middleman instead of an endpoint but
  is still part of the flow.

Flow:

  Various inputs -> dynamic converters -> various outputs

  This is essentially advertising transcoding

The output system is some CRUD

The output can FEED BACK into the input. Since it's a single system that
monitors this process, it can be protected against feedback loops. This allows
creation and correction of messaging.

Business owners want a known output for a known input. The output can be a set of odds so long
as it's not odds of odds ... that is to say it can be 1 in 10, but not a 1 in 10 of being 1 in 10
and a 2 in 10 of being a 3 in 10 and so on.

Convergence is the *only* important number. If a method irritates 80% but has a 10% convergence and
that's the best, then that method is the one to do.

The objective is a virtuous cycle feedback machine that can generate clients + testimonials.

kinds of ads:

  * Introduction: Before a sale, before first buy
  * Reminder: Before a sale, to steal customers ("we try harder")
  * Reminder: After a sale, for referrals or return business.

With all it should feel personal.

Customer fears
  Small businesses are preyed on by services and consultants:
    SEO Bots leeches SMM and scams

  They want tools, not solutions, not consultants, not services.
  Shouldn't pretend to know an answer or to care or to listen, instead, be a hammer.

  They hate yelp because the business model converts that tool into a hustle

  Success is tied too much to a specific service such as instagram. They don't like the reliance.

  Different systems work for different types of businesses. Followers don't always lead to sales.

  Business owners don't mind if their BUSINESS is on social media, just that they don't want to necessarily personally be.

Internally we should have different classes of objects, types, and satisfiability for them.

This will surface as different services


For instance

  image   4x3 1x1 3x4 9x16 16x9 
  video   ''
  vector  ''
  text    word and line count

Then there's the purpose of each

  logo, phone, email, social media, address, hours, etc.

Then things are either "live" or not.

For a user what they see is a set of layout/requirements along with satisfiability needs.

The system is effectively a "meat grinder":

  respiration cycle:
    Inputs are scanned.
    Layouts are generated.
      Notifications are sent to the user
    Outputs are sent to their CRUD/email places
