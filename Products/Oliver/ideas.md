image/card proxy

When sharing things on fb and twitter, the idea is to be able to provide custom images and text for it through a proxy.

Essentially the site is 

  [ upload asset ]
  [ title text ]
  [ subtitle text ]
  [ link ]

  [ go ]

The interesting thing is bit.ly at least doesn't do it. It's an obvious brand extension. I can't imagine they haven't thought of it.
