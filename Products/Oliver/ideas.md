## image/card proxy

Probably not core product

When sharing things on fb and twitter, the idea is to be able to provide custom images and text for it through a proxy.

Essentially the site is 

  [ upload asset ]
  [ title text ]
  [ subtitle text ]
  [ link ]

  [ go ]

The interesting thing is bit.ly at least doesn't do it. It's an obvious brand extension. I can't imagine they haven't thought of it.


## Third party stickers

Eventually core product

This is an extension to the layout. So long as they are permitted we can provide things such as certifications and
third party stickers (for instance, find us on postmates).
